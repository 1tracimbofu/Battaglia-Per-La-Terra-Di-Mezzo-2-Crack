# angular tree component

## Call for maintainers
It's been a long road, and now - I'm ready to hand over the keys.

Maintaining this fabulous component was a thrill for me.  
Seeing so many developers around the world using it, enjoying it, and complimenting me about it - was a truly satisfying experience.  

I no longer feel I can truly support the community, and there is much more to do for this library and its users.

I would like to propose someone or some company from the community to take over the library.
Giving up a baby is not easy, and I'd like to make sure that whoever takes over - will be dedicated to keeping a clean code, green tests, and also support the community.

That being said - I think the community should support itself as well.
That's why I opened the Slack community, with already over 120 members, and growing still.

To apply to maintain the library, please contact me via this form:

Cheers

Windows users - if it doesn't work try `npm run example:cli:win`.  

To run tests locally - make sure port 4200 is available and run:
```
$ npm run example:cli  # Wait until webpack finishes and http://localhost:4200 is available
$ npm run test:dev
```

Please check the issues / project before starting to work on a feature / bug to make sure it's not already in progress.
